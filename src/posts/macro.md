Itâ€™s been more than 5 years since I joined my current employer [remerge](remerge.io) and the reason for this long stay (relative to retention in tech industry) is the management style and company culture at Remerge, which I call macro management.

I found the compnay culture good (and others too if you check [glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.in/Reviews/Remerge-Reviews-E1200273.htm)). Most of my team members are with company for 4+ years while the compnay itself founded in 2014. If I ever have my own company I will copy the managment style and culture of remerge.
So this blog is about what made remerge culture success and how it helps both company and employees (and not about hey look at my workplace its so cool.)

1. Thinking about culture from day 1

- remerge had a document about how the culture should be from initial days when the company was not profitable yet. So making sure culture is not a after thought made it core part of it. Also its not just in words but in the consistent actions of founders/managmetn style which makes it propogate it to entire company

2. Transparecny

- All the information about compnay (strategy, guiding policy, problems in hand etc) accessible to everyone including financial numbers. This helps everyone to take decision quickly and understand the whole company
- CEO does a team meeting every 2 weeks where he shares information about market change, how company is doing, if we need any strategy change etc. This meeting is recorded along with a meeing document and shared in slack. So everyone are kept upto date with any changes, so you dont feel distanced from the compnay direction.
- Every quarter CEO publishes a document called heartbeats where every team adds what was done in last quarter in few sentences, with this you can keep up with other teams at a high level.
- This also improves the colleberation between the teams as it brings compnay wide alignment

3. Autonomy & trust

- Compnay believes in trust and autonomy instead of telling what to do & how to do etc. This has made people to take more ownership in their work and more engaged.
- You are encouraged to do deep focused work which brings long term value than being available on slack always.
- People leading the teams are competent at the work they do and they grew with the company, who are there when one needs more context and understand nuances. Their job is not to micro manage anyone.
- Often people structure their work day which makes them more productive.

4. No blame culture

- There is understanding that everyone makes mistakes and we learn from it. So you could work/talk with your guards down. This improves the psychological safety.
- One of the bug in production costed company close to half a million in revenue, but this was never pinned down on the employee who built that feature instead shared as learning and how we could avoid in future. And that employee continued to work with remerge more than 5 years.

5. Striving for excellence and efficiency

- There is always focus on excellence and effienciency, this challenges you to learn and grow at work.

6. Feedback culture

- There is a tool which collects feedback regularly from everyone and often this is shared in compnay wide team meeting and addressed when there are questions.
