Hi,

I am Praveen and ReHashed is my attempt to do long form writing on the things I read/hear or have experience on.

This blog is built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) and deployed using [render](https://render.com).

I also do shortform writing on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/naveepra.bsky.social)

Its source code is [here on github](https://github.com/metapraveen/rehashed/)

Render makes it so easy that when I do git push it publishes my blog free of cost which makes writing blog such a joy.
