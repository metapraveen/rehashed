I recently listened a <a herf="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/how-dopamine-shapes-your-habits-and-productivity-tj-power/id1587142091?i=1000670956558" target="_blank">podcast </a> about how different brain chemicals form shapes our habits and motivation levels. I took notes while listening as it was too much to absorb at once.
This blog is my notes with with my perspective about it.

The 4 main brain chemicals which effect our habits/motivation are Dopamine, Oxytocin Serotonin and Endorphins (D.O.S.E.)

#### Dopamine

Dopamine is a chemical that our brain needs for its reward system. The brain releases dopamine to make you feel good when you achieve something or engage in an activity, reinforcing that behavior. Because of this reward chemical, we feel motivated to do things. Since the motivation to do things we seek is a core part of life, the proper functioning of this chemical is crucial.

The current lifestyle, designed with tech and an abundance of things, makes it easy to hijack dopamine, leading to unhealthy habits. With social media, phone notifications, smoking, etc., the brain gets a high dose of dopamine constantly, which then crashes in the absence of this stimuli. This leads to low motivation for activities like studying, cooking, or running, which release dopamine in a more gradual and sustainable manner. This has become one of the main reasons many of us struggle to do the things we want to pursue.

Some common symptoms that indicate your dopamine not functioning well

- Low motivation for the things you want to do
- Difficulty in focusing
- Lack of pleasure in things you enjoyed once
- Craving for stimulants like coffee, sugary snack or checking phone often

What can you do to improve dopamine function?

- Phone fasting

  - No phone at the start or end of the day. You donâ€™t want to crash your dopamine as soon as you wake up or before going to sleep.

  - Turn off all notifications, and keep them only for your family and loved ones. This is like taking control back from your phone, which constantly stimulates you with notifications that are 99% of the time unimportant.

- Flow state

  - Set aside a few hours each day for deep work, where you focus on a single task without distractions. Deep work increases focus & attention also reduces mental fatigue you get from constant context switching.
  - Studies show that our brain needs around 15 minutes to get into a flow state. Once there, your brain becomes hyper-focused on the task, generating good, gradual dopamine.
  - Engaging in interesting or challenging work, listening to music, or even cleaning your home can help you enter a flow state.

- Boredom

  - Brain needs period of time where its gets bored so it can reset its receptors and gets creative

- Cold showers

  - which can lead to increase in dopamine levels by 2.5x. You dont need to do ice plunges, doing ~30s of cold shower at the end of bath will also do.

- Long walks in nature

  - Nature is our species' home. Going for long walks without your phone or headphones gives your brain time to daydream and actively chase your dreams.

- Discipline

  - Being disciplined raises your baseline dopamine, which increases motivation in other areas of life. For example, cleaning your desk before work not only feels good, but it also motivates you to do better work because your dopamine levels are improved.
