This blog is my notes about the podcast I listened recenlty about how brain chemicals effect our habits and motivation.

The 4 main brain chemicals which effect our habits are Dopamine, Oxytocin Serotonin and Endorphins (DOSE)

Dopamine
Dopamine is the chemical that our brain needs as this is a reward system of brain. It makes you feel good when achieve something or engage in a habit hence it reinforces behavior. Because of this reward chemical we feel motivated to do things which releases dopamine in brain.

Current lifestyle is designed with tech and abundance of things makes it easy to hijack dopamine which leads to unhealthy habits. With social media, phone notifications, smoking etc brain gets high dose of dopamine constantly which then crashes in the absesnce of this stimuli. This leads to low motivation to do things like studying, cooking or running which releases dopamine in more gradual and sustainable manner. Motivation to do the things we want to pursue in the core of life and current lifestyle makes it super hard by crashing our motivation levels.

what you could do to avoid this ?
Phone fasting

No phone when you wake up and before bedtime. You dont want to crash your dopamine as soon as you wake up.
Turn off all notifcations and keep them only for your family & loved ones. This is like taking control back from phone which is constantly stimulating you with notifications which are 99% of time not important.
Flow state

Keep few hours of day to do deep work where you focus on single task without any distractions.
As per studies our brain needs around 15 min to get into flow state then our brain gets hyperlocked into one thing you focus on and generates good gradual dopamine.
Interesting work, music or even cleaning home can make you enter flow state
Start your day with some action like brusing, streaching or making bead instead of phone

Let your brain bore when you have free time, this resets the dopamine receptors and also you get more creative

Cold showers which can lead to increase in dopamine levels by 2.5x. You dont need to do ice plunges, doing ~30s of cold shower at the end of bath will also do.

Figure out your pursuit

Go for long walks in nature without phone or headphone whcih gives brain space to think what you want to pursue. If you have something you are chasing its less likely you fall into the trap of quick rewards of modern life.
As a human species nature is hour home and going for long walk in natrue helps brain to figure out what it wants to pursue
Discipline

Being disciplined raises your baseline dopamine which leads to motivation in other things you want to pursue. For. e.g. cleaning your desk before work not only feels good it also motivates you to do better work because now you have better dopamine levels.
